          p Kaspersky decided to move its one print media insertion budget to online channels during Pohela Baishakh 2014. Webable was challenged to create a huge hype on the day and make a mark. It was a splash and dash campaign; objective was to make a lot of noise and promote Kaspersky anti-virus.

        p We created a landing page in Kaspersky’s website with a list of all products and discounts offered on Pohela Boishakh. People could sign up with their contact details to get a discount code which they could use when they were buying the software in stores.

        p We ran a multi-channel campaign on Facebook and G&R to drive people to Kaspersky’s landing page. We were provided with a color scheme of green and red that was ‘destined to sell’. We tested out 7 more variations of color scheme with 10% of the budget in an hour. We found 3 contents to be performing much better than others and optimized budget accordingly.
