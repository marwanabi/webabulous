        h3 Social Media Marketing
        p We don’t believe in robots. Robots can’t create meaningful human connections with your audience. It is the collection of impressions that your customers have about your brand - both offline and online, that makes your identity meaningful. Dedicated account managers, designers, copywriters and community managers give a human tone to your brand and drive conversations in social media.
        p We use specialized tools to manage your social media efficiently. We cover Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Slideshare, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr and Google+. We do organic and paid. Campaigns and retainers. We believe social media is a means, not an end.
